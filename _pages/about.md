Welcome to e-meet you ! 

I am currently a Postdoc at the [Department of Basic Neuroscience](https://www.unige.ch/medecine/neuf/en/accueil-2) in the group of üChristian Lüscher](https://www.addictionscience.unige.ch/). I am working on the connection of overweight with the hedonic system, typically associated with substance abuse. Before coming to Geneva, I worked with [Andreas Lüthi](https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=35) at the [Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research (FMI)](https://www.fmi.ch/), where I received my PhD. During my time at the FMI, I contributed to a number of studies, mostly through facilitating data analysis, the two first are from [Julien Courtin](https://www.bordeaux-neurocampus.fr/en/staff/julien-courtin/) and Lema Massi and investigated the [involvment of the BLA in instrumental goal directed behavior](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abg7277) and a [specific connection from the BLA to the PAG](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abq1637), respectively. You can read my first Paper from my PhD, investigating the specifics of the involvment of BLA processing in specific-valence on [biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.13.618086v1.abstract) - with more to come ! 
During my Masters at the [Max Plank Institute in Tübingen (IMPRS)](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/), I worked with [Aristides Arrenberg](https://arrenberg-lab.de/) and explored how the Pretectum and Tectum of larval Zebrafish [process rotational and translational optic flow](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12915-019-0648-2) and [how motion responsive receptive fields are distributed](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(19)31681-X). Moreover I found my passion for building setups, when I developed a [spherical arena for accurately displaying visual stimuli](https://elifesciences.org/articles/63355), an adaptation of a previously existing cylindrical arena and helped uncover the [current limitations of visual stimulation systems](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81904-2).

When I am not in the lab, I am an avid traveler, art enthusiast, lover of theater and opera, skiier, aspiring hobby athlete and bookworm.

I am always happy to talk, please reach out via E-Mail if you'd like to chat or collaborate !
